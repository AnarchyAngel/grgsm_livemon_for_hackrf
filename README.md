# grgsm_livemon_for_hackrf
# This should only be used for educational purposes only!!
This is a modifiedd version of the grgsm_livemon to make it work with hackrf, for some reason they took it out of recent distrobutions including RF focused linux distros like DragonOS. That was foolish, so i brought back the joy. Open in GNU Radio Companion, build, and play.

Example useage after building: 
python grgsm_livemon.py -a -g 30 -f <tower freq found with kal>M
